# GoogleScholar_PythonParser
Our project is the parsing of the sites on Python

This is a method for extracting information from websites. This method is primarily aimed at converting unstructured data - in HTML format - on the Internet into structured data: databases or spreadsheets. Site parsing involves accessing the Internet directly via HTTP or via a web browser.
Action sequencing
1)Get the url of the page we want to fetch data from.
2)Copy or download the HTML content of the page.
3)Parse the HTML content and get the data you need.
This sequence will help you navigate to the URL of the desired page, retrieve the HTML content, and parse the required data. But sometimes you need to first enter a site and then go to a specific address to get the data. In this case, another step is added to enter the site.

To analyze HTML content and get the necessary data, use the "Beautiful Soup" library.                                                                                   
To log in to a website, go to the desired URL in a single session, and download HTML content, we will use the Selenium library. Selenium Python helps with button clicks, content input, and other manipulations.
